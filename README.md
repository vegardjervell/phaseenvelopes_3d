# Phase Envelopes in 3d

These scripts use [ThermoPack](https://thermotools.github.io/thermopack/) to generate the three dimensional phase envelope of a binary mixture in $TPZ$-space, in order to illustrate how different cross-sections of this envelope give rise to the more commonly seen $TP$-, $Txy$-, and $Pxy$-phase envelopes.

The scripts were used to generate some of the figures in [folk.ntnu.no/vegargje/termonotat.pdf](folk.ntnu.no/vegargje/termonotat.pdf), of which a version is also found in this repository.
